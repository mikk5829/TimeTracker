# How to React
1. Install [node js](https://nodejs.org/en/) 
2. Clone this repo
3. I recommend [WebStorm IDE from JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) to code 
4. Go to cloned repo and run `npm install` from root (this installs all packages)
5. Now run `npm start` from root, and maybe open a browser and go to http://localhost:3000, alternatively open WebStorm and open `package.json` and click the start icon left of `"start": "react-scripts start",`.

## Guides
1. Read https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html (React is combining TS and HTML in one file.)
2. Very short intro to MUI: https://mui.com/getting-started/usage/ Mikkel can elaborate (MUI is instead of using css.)
